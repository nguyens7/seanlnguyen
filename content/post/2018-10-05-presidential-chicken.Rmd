I remember back in undergrad when I visited my friends at Michigan State and they took me to the residential dining hall and how I had typical dorm food like salad bar, burgers, hot dogs, fries etc.  The dining halls have improved drastically since then and now the undergraduate students have it great with so many options available to them.  

# Eat at State 

A common theme in the lab is to ask one another what do you have for lunch today?  Sometimes we don't bring anything and our options are to go to the international center food court, the restaurants on Grand River or the residential dining halls.  MSU employees have a great option to buy admission into the dining hall at a discounted rate so I always tag along with them so they can swipe me in.  We typically preview the menus at [eatatstate.msu.edu](https://eatatstate.msu.edu/) and will choose to go to the dining hall one with the best menu.    One of my favorite dishes from the cafeteria is Presidential Chicken which is a chicken dish with an alfredo like sauce with vegetables and is wrapped up in puff pastry envelope.  It tastes great and is exponentially better than the food I've had at weddings.  We haven't seen the dish on the menu in well over a year so I decided to see if I could scrape the menus and make a quick shiny dashboard to figure out the next time they would serve it. 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(rvest)

library(lubridate)
```

# Generate urls

```{r}
domain <- "https://eatatstate.msu.edu/menu/"
shaw <- "The%20Vista%20at%20Shaw/all/"
sny_phy <- "The%20Gallery%20at%20Snyder%20Phillips/all/"
landon <- "Heritage%20Commons%20at%20Landon/all/"

dining_halls <- c(shaw, sny_phy, landon)

# List of dates
future_date <- ymd(today()) + days(10)
dates <- seq(ymd(today()), future_date, by = 'day')

# Number of dining halls
dining_hall_no <- length(dining_halls) %>%
  unlist()

# Create lunch urls
day_url <- dining_halls %>% 
  map(~paste(domain, .x, dates, sep = "")) %>%
  unlist()

dining_halls
dates
day_url %>% 
  head()
```
```{r}
# Create dinner urls
dinner <- "?field_mealtime_target_id=191"

night_url <- dining_halls %>% 
  map(~paste(domain, .x, dates, dinner, sep = "")) %>%
  unlist()

# Combine url list
all_url <- c(day_url, night_url)

all_url %>% 
  head()
```

### Dates and Time
```{r}
# Date
date <- rep(dates, times = 2 * dining_hall_no)

# Cafe

no_dates <- length(dates) 
names <- str_replace_all(dining_halls, "%20|\\/all\\/"," ")
cafe <- rep(names, each = no_dates, times = 2)

# Time
time <- rep(c("Lunch", "Dinner"), each = no_dates * dining_hall_no)
time
```

### Scrape
```{r}
# Menu 
menu <- all_url %>%   
 map(~read_html(.x) %>% 
      html_nodes(".meal-title") %>% 
      html_text()) 

menu[1]
```


### Create a data frame
```{r}
food <- tibble(date, cafe, time, menu) %>% 
  unnest(menu) 

food %>% 
  head(15)
```

I made it on Monday this week and to my surprise I saw that they would be serving it today for dinner in Landon! 
```{r}
food %>% 
  filter( str_detect(menu, "Presidential")) 
```


We can also filter to look at the menu for today only.
```{r}
food %>% 
  filter(date == today())
```

# Wordcloud
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)

# MSU pallete colors  
pal <- c("#97A2A2","#F08521","#6E005F","#F08521","#97A2A2","#0DB14B")

set.seed(1234)

food %>% 
  unnest_tokens(menu, menu) %>% 
  count(menu, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  rename(word = menu) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>% 
  with(wordcloud(word, n, random.order = FALSE, max.words = 40, color = pal,fixed.asp = TRUE))

```


# Shiny Dashboard
Now that we learned how to make a wordcloud, scrape the menu into a tidy data frame we can work on making a interact with the data by making a shiny dashboard.

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

ui <- dashboardPage(skin = "green",
  dashboardHeader(title = "Eat at State"),
  dashboardSidebar( selectInput(inputId = 'dininghall',
                  label = 'Choose Dining Hall:',
                  choices = c("All","The Vista at Shaw ",
                              "The Gallery at Snyder Phillips ",
                              "Heritage Commons at Landon "))
                  
                  
  ),
  
  dashboardBody(
    # Boxes need to be put in a row (or column)
    fluidRow(
      box(dataTableOutput("menu"),title = "MSU Dining Menu",
          width = 12, status = "primary")
      )
    )
  )


server <- function(input, output) {
  
   menu <- reactive({
    if(input$dininghall == "All")
        return(food)
    else
      food %>% 
       filter(cafe %in% input$dininghall)

  })

  output$menu <- renderDataTable(menu())
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
