      <description>For Now…  SpaceX launched Falcon Heavy this week and I remembered how Elon Musk noted that it would have twice the thrust of any rocket currently in existence. I was intrigued by this statement and decided to look further and compare the thrusts of other rockets of the past and rockets that are planned in the future.
Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying.</description>
