      <description>I remember back in undergrad when I visited my friends at Michigan State and they took me to the residential dining hall since they had a meal plan. The cafeteria had typical dorm food like salad bar, burgers, hot dogs, fries etc. Fortunately, the dining halls have improved drastically since then and now the undergraduate students have it great with so many options available to them.
Eat at State A common theme in the lab is to ask one another what do you have for lunch today?</description>

      <description>I’ve been using the iOS Sleep Cycle app to track my sleeping since late 2014 and have accumulated quite a bit of information about my sleeping habits. I wanted to see if I could do some exploratory data analysis and try out some different packages to clean up and visualize my data. The data from the app comes in a csv file and contains information like date, sleep quality, sleep duration, and more recently it can integrate with the pedometer so you can get the number of steps in a given day.</description>

      <description>For Now…  SpaceX launched Falcon Heavy this week and I remembered how Elon Musk noted that it would have twice the thrust of any rocket currently in existence. I was intrigued by this statement and decided to look further and compare the thrusts of other rockets of the past and rockets that are planned in the future.
Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying.</description>
