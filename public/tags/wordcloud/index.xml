      <description>I remember back in undergrad when I visited my friends at Michigan State and they took me to the residential dining hall since they had a meal plan. The cafeteria had typical dorm food like salad bar, burgers, hot dogs, fries etc. Fortunately, the dining halls have improved drastically since then and now the undergraduate students have it great with so many options available to them.
